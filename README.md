Sparse Tensors for Python

Here's an implementation of Sparce Tensors for Python originaly written as a part of Numerical Linear Aglebra course project at Skoltech.

Requirements:

- numpy
- scipy

To use it, import sp3tensor from sp3tensor

To run tests, run sp3tensor.py

See usage in simrank_example.py (SimRank on tensors).
